# Svelte Markdown Blog
This is a cool project from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhScu3uqGd0) that I followed along with to try to learn Svelte and SvelteKit quickly. I will still need to do a little more work before I fully understand all the code in this repo, but my impression of Svelte is pretty good so far. It seems like you can make stuff very quickly using Svelte and the fact that it is a compiler rather than a framework seems very cool to me. Will have to see how it holds up in a bigger project though.
